Existing defenses either impose high overheads or fail against advanced attacks. This paper addresses these issues by introducing and evaluating PriVA-C, a fingerprinting defense mechanism tailored specifically for voice assistants. Unlike prior approaches that treat voice assistant traffic as generic web traffic, we analyze its unique characteristics to design a more effective defense. Our approach prioritizes limiting information leakage rather than targeting specific attack vectors, achieving a significant reduction in attacker accuracy from 89% to 13%. We also propose a more practically deployable version of our defense, which protects only traffic directed to the primary voice assistant domain, reducing attacker accuracy to 19%. We implement a functional prototype using the Alexa SDK, conduct user testing, and assess its performance using real network traffic. Our results demonstrate that our proposed defense effectively mitigates fingerprinting attacks while maintaining low overhead and preserving the user experience","tags":["IoT","Fingerprinting","Privacy","Voice Assistant"],"title":"PriVA-C: Defending Voice Assistants from Fingerprinting Attacks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aafaq Sabir","Abhinaya S.B.","Dilawer Ahmed","Anupam Das"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1754697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1754697600,"objectID":"a5b461c5d86d8aaaca756b58fc1fdbb7","permalink":"https://dilawer.org/publication/ieeesp25-analyzing/","publishdate":"2025-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ieeesp25-analyzing/","section":"publication","summary":"With the rapid adoption of smart voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and the potential for more growth with large language model-powered assistants, as well as the introduction of “advertising ID” within Alexa, it is inevitable that advertisements (ads) will become prevalent on such platforms if not already. Although Alexa permits third-party developers to include ads within voice apps (known as “skills”) and enables targeted advertisement through ad identifiers, Alexa also lists an ad policy that restricts ads within skill responses, notifications, or reminders except in defined cases. However, it remains unclear whether all developers comply with these policies or attempt to bypass vetting processes to publish noncompliant ads. This paper presents the first large-scale analysis of advertising on the Alexa platform, examining ad prevalence, characteristics, and adherence to platform policies. We introduce an automated ad detection method using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) with 88.92% accuracy and, using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, achieve 94.52% accuracy in identifying potential policy-violating ads. Analyzing 45,477 Alexa skills, we find that 13.58% include ads or promotional content, with themes such as travel and entertainment. Notably, some ads come from skills by Amazon-promoted agencies like “Vixen Labs” while others are generated by agencies solely focused on voice assistant platforms, such as “Skilled Creative.” Our model identifies approximately 29.18% of ads as possible policy violations. We reported our findings to Amazon, resulting in a bug bounty reward. The proposed system aims to enhance Alexa's vetting by automatically flagging potential ad violations and demonstrates how fine-tuned LLMs can support policy enforcement on voice platforms.","tags":["IoT","Fingerprinting","Privacy","Voice Assistant"],"title":"Analyzing Ad Prevalence, Characteristics, and Compliance in Alexa Skills","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dilawer Ahmed","Aafaq Sabir","Anupam Das"],"categories":null,"content":" The Voice Assistant fingerprint diagram ","date":1691539200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691539200,"objectID":"b26fffd3d46b8e2c8c849205b2ec6d02","permalink":"https://dilawer.org/publication/usenixsec23-va-fingerprinting/","publishdate":"2023-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/usenixsec23-va-fingerprinting/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that multiple voice assistant platforms can be fingerprinting equally effectively.

Ubiquitous vehicular cameras capture bystanders like people or cars nearby without their awareness. To address privacy concerns, most existing works either blur out direct identifiers such as vehicle license plates and human faces, or obfuscate whole video frames. However, the former solution is vulnerable to re-identification attacks based on general features, and the latter severely impacts utility of the transformed videos. In this paper, we propose an INStance-level PrIvacy-pREserving (INSPIRE) video transformation framework for vehicular camera videos. INSPIRE leverages deep neural network models to detect and replace sensitive object instances in vehicular videos with their non-existent counterparts. We design INSPIRE as a modular framework to enable flexible customization of protected instance categories and their protection modules. An implementation of INSPIRE focused on protecting people and cars is described, which we tested on six re-identification datasets and three realworld vehicular video datasets to evaluate its privacy protection and utility preservation capability. Results show that INSPIRE can thwart 97% of re-identification attacks for people and cars while maintaining a 0.75 object detection mean average precision on transformed instances. We also demonstrate experimentally that INSPIRE is robust against model inversion attacks. Compared to solutions that provide comparable privacy protection, INSPIRE achieves relatively 1.76 times higher counting accuracy and 31.61% higher object detection mean average precision.","tags":[],"title":"INSPIRE: Instance-level Privacy-preserving Transformation for Vehicular Camera Videos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dilawer Ahmed","Anupam Das","Fareed Zaffar"],"categories":null,"content":" Similar devices have similar fingerprints ","date":1657843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657843200,"objectID":"04f10af24f1061ed7f6057fa3250612c","permalink":"https://dilawer.org/publication/pets22-iot-fingerprinting/","publishdate":"2022-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pets22-iot-fingerprinting/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that not only is it possible to effectively fingerprint 188 IoT devices (with over 97% accuracy), but also to do so even with multiple instances of the same make-and-model device.
