abstract: "Existing fingerprinting attacks on IoT devices have
primarily focused on closed-world settings and lack comprehensive open-world analysis. In this poster, we try to understand how
effectively an attacker can fingerprint unseen targeted IoT devices
when building a classifier using either devices manufactured by
the same company or devices with similar functionality. We find
that an adversary benefits when the training set contains at least
one device type per company, enabling it to predict the other
devices manufactured by the same company even when the device
functionality might be different"
