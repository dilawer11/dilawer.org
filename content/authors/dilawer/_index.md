I am a Software Engineer at Microsoft, where I apply my expertise in security and privacy to build robust systems. I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science at North Carolina State University, advised by Dr. Anupam Das, where my research focused on Security and Privacy with an emphasis on IoT and Web Security as part of the Wolfpack Security and Privacy Lab (WSPR). I hold a BS in Computer Science from Lahore University of Management Sciences, class of 2020.
